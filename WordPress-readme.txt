Glossary block for the Gutenberg editor.
 
== Description ==
 
This plugin provides a multilanguage glossary-block for the WordPress-Gutenberg-Editor. It also includes a backend 
to add, update and remove entries from within the glossary.

* The plugin actively supports multi-language sites and offers the following languages in both the frontend and the backend:
    * English
    * French
    * German
    * Italian
* The backend has filtering options to filter by letter and language. 
* The colors of the frontend are completely adjustable.
* The frontend adjusts itself to fit the container size (responsive / mobile friendly).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= How can I add an additional language to the plugin? =

First, create a translation for the language your seeking to add. Afterwards, go to [Github](https://github.com/Arteeo/glossary-by-arteeo/issues) 
and create an issue about you wanting to add this language, we will then get in contact with you.
 
= A translation does not seem to be correct, what can I do? =
 
This is entirely possible since we do not natively speak all the languages supported by this plugin. Simply open an issue 
on [Github](https://github.com/Arteeo/glossary-by-arteeo/issues).
